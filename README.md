# Get started

If you have some basic tools installed (git, compiler and cmake) clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/MattiaMontanari/openGJK.git
```

followed by these commands:

```
cmake -E make_directory build
cmake -E chdir build cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. 
cmake --build build 
cmake -E chdir build/examples/c ./example_lib_opengjk_ce
```

If you get no errors, the successfull output is:

> `Distance between bodies 3.653650`. 

However, if you do get an error - any error - please file a bug! Support requests are welcome too.

Finally, you can install the library and its public header locally with:
``` 
cmake --install build
```

# Where to go next

With the commands above you have built a demo example tha invokes the openGJK library. The library is statically linked and the distance between two bodies is computed and returned. 

To learn how to use this library in your project the best place to start is the demo. Look at `main.c` and the other examples. In `examples/c/CMakeLists.txt` you can find how simple is to link using CMake.
